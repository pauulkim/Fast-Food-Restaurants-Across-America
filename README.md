# San Francisco Airbnb Activity
Airbnb is a platform that offers you someoneâ€™s home as a place to stay instead of a hotel. It acts as an intermediary between those who want to rent out space and those who are looking for space to rent. 

San Francisco has over 7,000 listings on Airbnb as of June 2019. 

In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis of the Airbnb dataset sourced from the [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html#disclaimers) website to understand how Airbnb is really being used in San Francisco. 

The data comes from three main files:
- `listings.csv` - Summary of listings data showing 16 attributes for each of the listings in San Francisco 
- `reviews.csv` - Detailed reviews given by the guests with 6 attributes in San Francisco
- `calendar.csv` - Detailed calendar data for listings in San Francisco
