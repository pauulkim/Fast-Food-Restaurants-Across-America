# San Francisco Airbnb Activity
Airbnb is a platform that offers you someoneâ€™s home as a place to stay instead of a hotel. It acts as an intermediary between those who want to rent out space and those who are looking for space to rent. 

San Francisco has over 7,000 listings on Airbnb as of June 2019. 

In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis of the Airbnb dataset sourced from the [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html#disclaimers) website to understand how Airbnb is really being used in San Francisco. 

The dataset comprises of three main tables:
- `listings` - Detailed listings data showing 96 attributes for each of the listings. 
- `reviews` - Detailed reviews given by the guests with 6 attributes. 
- `calendar` - Provides details about booking for the next year by listing.
