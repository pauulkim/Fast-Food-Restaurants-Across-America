# San Francisco Airbnb Activity
Airbnb is a platform that offers you someoneâ€™s home as a place to stay instead of a hotel. It acts as an intermediary between those who want to rent out space and those who are looking for space to rent. 

San Francisco has over 7,000 listings on Airbnb as of June 2019. 

In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis of the Airbnb dataset sourced from the [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html#disclaimers) website to understand listings in San Francisco. 

The data comes from one main file:
- `listings.csv` - Detailed listings data showing attributes for each of the listings in San Francisco
